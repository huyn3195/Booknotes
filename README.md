# Bookstagram
A Social Media revolves around books

**Link to project:** http://recruiters-love-seeing-live-demos.com/



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** PERN Stack, Redux, HTML, CSS, Botpress

I used Postgre as my Database, NodeJS and Express for my server and React for my frontend. I am planning to host this app on Heroky. I built a chatbot using Botpress to help with book recommendation

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
