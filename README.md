A Social Media revolves around books

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** PERN Stack, Redux, HTML, CSS, Botpress

I used Postgre as my Database, NodeJS and Express for my server and React for my frontend. I am planning to host this app on Heroky. I built a chatbot using Botpress to help with book recommendation.

## Optimizations
Implement Redis caching to improve the loading speed and use optimized query calls.

## How to run:
**Start server:** 
1. nvm use node
2. npm i
3. cd to server
4. Create your own env. The env examples can provide you help.
5. nodemon app.js

**Start client side:**
- cd to client
- npm i
- npm run build
